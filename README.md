# Big Data Team ML Course Projects

This repository contains selected homework and projects I completed during the Big Data Team Machine Learning course. The course covered Python coding, data analysis, and building machine learning models.

## Folders

### Python section/
Contains homework from the Python refresher module. Topics include:
- Bash scripting and using APIs.
- Regular expressions and text parsing.
- Working with SQLite databases.
- Writing Python functions and using data structures like Counter and defaultdict.

**Files:**
- `task_Momunov_Bakhyt_count_avg_article_size.sh` – Bash script to calculate average article size.
- `task_Momunov_Bakhyt_random.sh` – Bash script using random.org API.
- `sql_testing.py` – Simple SQLite database example.
- `py4bda_b2c2024q4_Momunov_Bakhyt_HW06.py` – Python exercises with regex, file parsing, and data analysis.

### ML section/
Contains machine learning homework where I built and trained simple ML models.

**Files:**
- `HW01.ipynb` – Basic ML and data preprocessing.
- `HW02.ipynb` – Classification models like Decision Tree and kNN.
- `HW07.ipynb` – Model evaluation and cross-validation.
- `HW08.ipynb` – Hyperparameter tuning.
